       <p>Hi there,</p>

       <p>
         Your Listify subscription was updated successfully - you are now on the <%= @plan_name.capitalize %> plan.
         Your next payment due will be for your new plan, with a pro-rata adjustment for the time you've spent on the new plan in the current billing period.
       </p>

       <p>If you need any help with this or would like to talk to us, reply to this email.</p>

       <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Have a great day,</p>
     </div>
