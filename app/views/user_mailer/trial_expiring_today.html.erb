       <p>Hi there,</p>

       <p>
         Your free trial of Listify is about to end. You can continue to use Listify for as little as £29 a month.
         Check out our pricing <%= link_to 'plans', pricing_url %> here.
       </p>
       <p>
         If you need a little more time to test Listify, we can offer you a one off, two week extension of the trial period, which you can set up by getting in touch with us.
       </p>

       <p>
         If Listify hasn’t quite met your needs, we’d love to know why and if there is anything we could change. 
         Reply to this email and we’ll see what we can do to help.
       </p>

       <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Have a great day,</p>
